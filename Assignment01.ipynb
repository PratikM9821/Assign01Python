        "1. Key Features of Python that Make it Popular\n",
        "Python is one of the most popular programming languages today, and here are some reasons why:\n",
        "\n",
        "Easy to Read and Write: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and resembles plain English, which makes it easier for beginners to learn and use.\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line by line, so you don't need to compile your code before running it. This speeds up the testing and debugging process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-Platform Compatibility: Python runs on various operating systems like Windows, MacOS, and Linux, which makes it highly versatile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Extensive Libraries: Python has a rich set of libraries and frameworks like NumPy for data science, TensorFlow for machine learning, and Django for web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamically Typed: You don't need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it; Python figures it out for you.\n",
        "\n",
        "Garbage Collection: Python automatically handles memory management, so you don't have to manually allocate or deallocate memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "General Purpose: Python can be used for web development, data analysis, automation, artificial intelligence, and much more.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Role of Predefined Keywords in Python\n",
        "In Python, keywords are special reserved words that have a specific meaning and function within the language. You can't use them as variable names because they are part of the language's syntax. Here's how some of them are used:\n",
        "\n",
        "if, else, elif: These are used for decision-making in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "for, while: These are used for loops (repeated execution).\n",
        "\n",
        "def: This is used to define a function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at an example of how these keywords work:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "def check_number(x):\n",
        "    if x > 0:\n",
        "        return \"Positive\"\n",
        "    elif x == 0:\n",
        "        return \"Zero\"\n",
        "    else:\n",
        "        return \"Negative\"\n",
        "\n",
        "# Test the function\n",
        "print(check_number(5))   # Positive\n",
        "print(check_number(0))   # Zero\n",
        "print(check_number(-3))  # Negative\n",
        "3. Mutable vs Immutable Objects in Python\n",
        "In Python, an object is either mutable (can be changed) or immutable (cannot be changed after creation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Mutable objects: These objects can be modified after they're created. Common examples are lists and dictionaries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Immutable objects: Once these objects are created, their content cannot be altered. Examples include strings, tuples, and integers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's look at examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "# Mutable: Lists\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "my_list[0] = 10  # Modifying the first element\n",
        "print(\"Modified list:\", my_list)  # Output: [10, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "# Immutable: Strings\n",
        "my_string = \"Hello\"\n",
        "# my_string[0] = \"h\"  # This will raise an error because strings are immutable\n",
        "4. Different Types of Operators in Python\n",
        "Python provides several types of operators to perform operations on variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, / (used for basic mathematical operations).\n",
        "\n",
        "Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= (used to compare two values).\n",
        "\n",
        "Logical Operators: and, or, not (used to combine conditional statements).\n",
        "\n",
        "Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, etc. (used to assign values to variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a quick example of how these operators work:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "# Arithmetic Operators\n",
        "a = 10\n",
        "b = 5\n",
        "print(\"Addition:\", a + b)  # Output: 15\n",
        "print(\"Multiplication:\", a * b)  # Output: 50\n",
        "\n",
        "# Comparison Operators\n",
        "print(\"Is a equal to b?\", a == b)  # Output: False\n",
        "\n",
        "# Logical Operators\n",
        "print(\"Both greater than 0?\", a > 0 and b > 0)  # Output: True\n",
        "\n",
        "# Assignment Operator\n",
        "a += 3  # Same as a = a + 3\n",
        "print(\"New value of a:\", a)  # Output: 13\n",
        "5. Type Casting in Python\n",
        "Type casting means converting a variable from one type to another, like from a string to an integer. It's helpful when you need to perform operations on incompatible types (like adding a number to a string). Python allows you to do type casting explicitly using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "# Converting a string to an integer\n",
        "num_str = \"100\"\n",
        "num_int = int(num_str)\n",
        "print(\"String to Integer:\", num_int)  # Output: 100\n",
        "\n",
        "# Converting a float to an integer\n",
        "float_num = 15.67\n",
        "int_num = int(float_num)  # This truncates the decimal part\n",
        "print(\"Float to Integer:\", int_num)  # Output: 15\n",
        "6. Conditional Statements in Python\n",
        "Conditional statements allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. The basic structure of a conditional statement in Python is:\n",
        "\n",
        "if: Checks a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "elif: Checks another condition if the previous one is False.\n",
        "\n",
        "else: Executes code when all other conditions are False.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "age = 20\n",
        "if age < 18:\n",
        "    print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
        "elif age == 18:\n",
        "    print(\"You are 18!\")\n",
        "else:\n",
        "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
        "7. Types of Loops in Python\n",
        "Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times. Python has two types of loops:\n",
        "\n",
        "for loop: This is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, string, or range).\n",
        "\n",
        "while loop: This repeats as long as a certain condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's see examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "python\n",
        "\n",
        "Copy\n",
        "# Example of a for loop\n",
        "for i in range(5):\n",
        "    print(\"For loop iteration:\", i)\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example of a while loop\n",
        "count = 0\n",
        "while count < 5:\n",
        "    print(\"While loop iteration:\", count)\n",
        "    count += 1"
